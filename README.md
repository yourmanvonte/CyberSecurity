Security Labs & Investigations

This repository contains documented defensive security investigations conducted as part of hands-on cybersecurity training. The focus of these labs is on developing practical SOC-level skills, including alert analysis, log review, threat identification, and clear incident documentation.

The investigations simulate real-world security scenarios and emphasize evidence-based analysis, structured reporting, and operational clarity rather than tool-specific walkthroughs.

Investigation Approach

Each investigation follows a consistent methodology:

- Review alerts, logs, or indicators of suspicious activity

- Analyze relevant data sources (SIEM outputs, system logs, network traffic)

- Identify and contextualize potential threats

- Document findings with supporting evidence

- Summarize conclusions and potential remediation considerations
